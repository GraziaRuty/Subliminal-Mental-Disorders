# Subliminal-Mental-Disorders
Meta-analyses: Unconscious processing of subliminal stimuli in mental disorders
We performed a systematic review of the available evidence about subliminal processing in panic disorder (PD). 
We conducted meta-analyses to compare: 
a) PD and healthy controls (HC) for processing of masked panic-related words.
b) PD and HC for processing of masked neutral words.
c) Processing of masked panic-related relative to neutral words within PD.
d) Processing of masked panic-related relative to neutral words within HC.
e) Masked vs unmasked presentations of panic-related relative to neutral words within PD.
f) Masked vs unmasked presentations of panic-related relative to neutral words within HC.
